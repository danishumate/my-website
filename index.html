                        and coding since I was very young. My father introduced me to computers when I was just 3 years old. My very first 
                        memory of a computer is the IMAC G3. My favorite thing to do, was play games at the time! ( mine was blue :p )

                            little webpage about me and my hobbies/intrests at the time. I always had in intrest in coding,
                            and  Im very excited to be able to continue growing these skills and make a career out of it!

                        <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
                            <p>
                                I enjoy writing code and seeing all the diffrent changes.
                                I love problem solving, just when something feels impossible
                                you figure out the problem and its the most satisfying feeling
                                in the world!
                            </p>
